* TODO: Although we can squeeze R/O and R/W blobs into 2 MB, we do not do
* so because:
*
* - (A minor reason) Not every 4 MB flash chip can write-protect just the
*   first 1 MB.
*
* - (The main reason) We do not know how many tools or scripts implicitly
*   assume that R/O section consumes the first half 2 MB.
*
* In the long run, we should find and fix all those tools and scripts that
* have incorrect implicit assumption of R/O section, but for now, we just
* cannot squeeze the image size down to 2 MB at the risk of wrongly write-
* protecting the R/W blobs.
