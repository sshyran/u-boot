Required properties:
 - clocks : One clock must be given, as a phandle to the Tegra's
	    CAR node and the clock number as a parameter:
     - the I2C clock to use for the peripheral

Example:

	i2c@7000c400 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-i2c";
		reg = <0x7000c400 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 84 0x4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car 54>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

in DTS file:

Required properties:
 - status: "okay" if the device is enabled (has devices attached)
 - clock-frequency: I2C bus clock freq in Hz, typically 100KHz-400KHz
 - nvidia,no-repeat-start: Some I2C devices (TPM infineon slb9645, for one)
	require that I2C bus be put in STOP state (instead of REPEATED_START
	state) between writing the address pointer and reading the data. This
	property is for this kind of devices. If this property is present, the
	Tegra I2C U-Boot driver will NOT set the REPEAT_START_MASK bit in the
	packet header. Use this flag on the bus of the crippled/picky device.

	i2c@7000c500 {
		status = "okay";
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		nvidia,no-repeat-start;
		tpm@20 {
			compatible = "infineon,slb9645-tpm";
			reg = <0x20>;
		};
	};
